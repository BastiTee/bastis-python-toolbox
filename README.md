# Basti's Python Toolbox

This project contains various python methods, modules and scripts that I use to do various things on various occasions for various reasons. You can copy-paste whatever you want from here. But please don't use this in any production system because I will (currently) not make sure that interfaces are stable over the course of version updates. But, hey, that's what forking is for, right? 

## Installing

Assuming that you have installed `pip` and `git` for your operating system you can install the toolbox by running::

    pip install git+git://github.com/BastiTee/bastis-python-toolbox#egg=bptbx

Refer to [the dependencies description](DEPENDS) to see what other projects you'll need to run specific modules.
