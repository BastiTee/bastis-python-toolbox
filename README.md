Basti's Python Toolbox
======================

Various python methods, modules and scripts that I use to do various things on various occasions for various reasons. You can copy-paste whatever you want from here. But please don't use this in any production system because I will (currently) not make sure that interfaces are stable over the course of version updates. But, hey, that's what forking is for, right?

Best, Basti.
